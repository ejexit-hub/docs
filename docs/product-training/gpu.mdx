# GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

## Introduction
This manual helps personnel at Exit Technologies Inc. understand GPUs, ensuring clear communication with clients and team members.

## 1. Overview
GPUs handle graphical computations, significantly impacting visual performance, graphics rendering, and processing speed for graphics-intensive tasks.

### Types of GPUs

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Integrated GPUs" description="Built into CPUs for basic tasks" type="info">
  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Built into CPUs, suitable for basic graphical tasks like web browsing, office work, and video streaming.</p>
  <p><strong>Typical VRAM:</strong> Shared with system memory (no dedicated VRAM).</p>
  <p><strong>Performance Range:</strong> Low power consumption, entry-level graphics.</p>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Intel UHD Graphics, AMD Radeon Vega (integrated in Ryzen CPUs), Apple M2 GPU.</p>
  <p><strong>Best For:</strong> Office work, streaming, basic 2D games, and low-demand graphical tasks.</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dedicated GPUs" description="Standalone cards for gaming & content creation" type="tip">
  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Standalone graphics cards designed for demanding tasks such as gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering.</p>

## 2. Key Specifications

### Memory (VRAM)
GPU-dedicated memory, commonly from 4GB up to 24GB or more. Professional GPUs may exceed 48GB for heavy workloads.

### Core Count
More cores typically translate to higher performance, especially in parallel processing tasks like rendering or AI training.

### Clock Speed
Measured in MHz/GHz; higher speeds enhance performance but also increase power usage and heat output.

## 3. Common Use Cases

### Gaming
High-performance GPUs enable immersive, real-time graphics, high refresh rates, and ray tracing for realistic visuals.

### Professional Applications
Video editing, CAD software, and 3D modeling rely on powerful GPUs for rendering efficiency and accuracy.

### AI & Machine Learning
Specialized GPUs are optimized for computational tasks, accelerating model training and inference speeds.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions
- **"Do I need a dedicated GPU?"**
  - Yes, if performing graphics-intensive tasks such as gaming, video editing, or professional design work.

- **"How much GPU memory (VRAM) do I need?"**
  - 4GB to 8GB for general use, 8GB+ for gaming or professional applications.

## 5. Practical Tips
- Identify client's specific use-case scenarios to recommend suitable GPU specifications.
- Simplify technical language to communicate GPU benefits clearly.
