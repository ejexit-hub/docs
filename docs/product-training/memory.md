# RAM (Memory)

## Introduction
This manual helps personnel at Exit Technologies Inc. understand memory (RAM), enhancing effective client and internal communication.

## 1. Overview
RAM (Random Access Memory) temporarily stores data actively used by a computer, directly impacting system speed and multitasking capability.

### Key Types:
- **DDR4/DDR5 RAM:** Common types used in modern computers, with DDR5 providing faster speeds and improved efficiency.
- **ECC RAM:** Includes error-correcting capabilities, ideal for servers and critical systems requiring reliability.

## 2. Key Specifications
- **Capacity:** Typically 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, or more.
- **Speed:** Measured in MHz; higher speeds improve performance.
- **Form Factor:** Desktop (DIMM), Laptop (SO-DIMM).

## 3. Common Use Cases
- General Computing: 8GB to 16GB recommended for smooth performance.
- Professional/Creative Tasks: 16GB to 64GB or more, depending on software and workloads.
- Servers/Data Centers: ECC RAM for data integrity and reliability.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions
- **"How much RAM do I need?"**
  - 8GB for general tasks, 16GB+ for multitasking and professional applications.

- **"What is ECC RAM, and do I need it?"**
  - ECC RAM corrects data errors, essential for servers and mission-critical tasks but unnecessary for typical desktop use.

## 5. Practical Tips
- Clearly determine the client’s performance requirements when recommending RAM capacity and speed.
- Simplify explanations to clearly communicate RAM’s impact on performance.
