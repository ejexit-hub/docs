# Networking

## Introduction
This manual helps personnel at Exit Technologies Inc. understand networking equipment basics, enhancing communication with clients and internal teams.

## 1. Networking Equipment Overview
Networking equipment connects devices within a network, enabling communication, data sharing, and internet access.

### Key Components:
- **Switches:** Connect multiple devices within a single network, facilitating efficient data transfer.
- **Routers:** Direct network traffic, connecting different networks, typically linking a local network to the internet.
- **Modems:** Provide internet access by converting signals between your network and your internet provider.
- **Wireless Access Points (WAPs):** Allow wireless devices to connect to wired networks using Wi-Fi.

## 2. Types of Networking Equipment
### Consumer Networking Equipment:
- Ideal for home or small office setups.
- Examples: Basic routers and modems (Netgear, Linksys, TP-Link).

### Business Networking Equipment:
- Offers advanced management, security, and scalability for professional use.
- Examples: Cisco Catalyst switches, Ubiquiti UniFi access points, Meraki routers.

### Enterprise Networking Equipment:
- Designed for large-scale, complex network environments needing robust management and high performance.
- Examples: High-capacity managed switches, enterprise-grade routers from Cisco and Juniper.

## 3. Networking Specifications â€“ Simplified Breakdown
- **Speed:** Measured in Mbps or Gbps. Higher speeds mean quicker data transfer.
- **Ports:** The number and type of ports determine how many devices can connect.
- **Managed vs. Unmanaged:** Managed devices offer advanced features (security, performance monitoring, traffic management), whereas unmanaged devices offer basic connectivity with minimal setup.

## 4. Common Questions & Effective Responses
- **"What is the difference between a switch and a router?"**
  - Switches connect devices within the same network; routers connect different networks (such as your home or business network to the internet).

- **"Should I use managed or unmanaged switches?"**
  - Use unmanaged for simple setups, managed for more control, security, and advanced network management.

- **"What does a Wireless Access Point do?"**
  - It allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network through Wi-Fi, expanding wireless connectivity coverage.

## 5. Practical Tips
- Clearly determine client needs to recommend suitable networking equipment.
- Simplify technical language to effectively communicate features and benefits.
- Use real-world scenarios to illustrate how different networking devices meet various business needs.
