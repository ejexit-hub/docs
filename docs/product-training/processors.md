# Processors (CPU)

## Introduction
This manual helps personnel at Exit Technologies Inc. understand processors (CPUs), facilitating clear client and internal communication.

## 1. Overview
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the core component that performs calculations and processes instructions, significantly influencing a computer's performance.

:::info **Key Types** (Click to expand)

- **Consumer CPUs:** Suitable for general computing tasks, ranging from everyday use to gaming.
- **Server CPUs:** Optimized for multitasking, reliability, and performance in data centers and enterprise environments.

:::

## 2. Key Specifications

:::tip **Important Specs** (Click to expand)

- **Core Count:** More cores allow efficient multitasking and enhanced performance.
- **Clock Speed:** Measured in GHz; higher speeds enable faster processing.
- **Cache Size:** Temporary storage for rapid data access; larger caches improve performance.
- **Socketâ€¯Type:** The physical interface that mates the CPU to the motherboard; matching socket types are essential for hardware compatibility and future upgrade options.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions
- **"How many cores do I need?"**
  - 4 to 6 cores for general tasks; 8+ cores for gaming, creative work, or servers.

- **"What's more important: clock speed or core count?"**
  - Core count for multitasking and heavy workloads; clock speed for single-task performance.

## 5. Practical Tips

:::tip **Best Practices** (Click to expand)

- Clearly define the client's usage scenario to recommend suitable CPU specifications.
- Simplify technical language to effectively communicate processor benefits.
